Here is a quick overview of the project:

 . User goes against the CPU with both grids being given
 . The User's ships are visible as the CPU's are not as the purpose is to try to locate the CPU's ships
 . If the User/CPU hit a part of their opponent's ships, a flame would occur, if not, the slot would be crossed out 
 . If the User hits all of the CPU's ships, the User wins
 . If the CPU hits all of the User's ships, the CPU wins
